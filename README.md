# SCT_CS_1
This is a simple Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption, where each letter in the text is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

This tool allows users to:
Encrypt plain text using a shift value.
Decrypt the encrypted text back to the original message.
Keep spaces, numbers, and special characters unchanged.

⚙️ Features

✅ User-friendly console input/output
✅ Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters
✅ Handles non-alphabetic characters without modification
✅ Simple implementation with reusable functions

 How It Works:

The user enters a message.
The user provides a shift value (e.g.,45).
The program:
Encrypts the message using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
Decrypts the message back to the original text.
